## Project Overview
For this project the team have created a REST API, this purpose of this REST API is to fetch information about Spartans (Trainees) from a database, giving the user the ability to view all the Spartans and their info, such as their name and what course they are on, plus the period of the time they are on the course. In addition, giving the user access to view the available courses that are active and inactive.

Furthermore, our REST API provides API keys for users that request it, allowing the users to modify/add more spartan to the database. While a higher-level API key which is only accessible by Admins, allows for more access of the API, for instance the ability to add and deleted courses and API keys for normal user.

## Instructions
1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your chosen file location to store the cloned project files.
2. On GitHub navigate to the main page of the Sparta REST API repo.
3. Click the green drop down menu 'CODE', and then copy the URL that appears.
4. Head back to Git Bash and type ```git clone "<URL>"```.
5. Now open the Sparta REST API file with the IDE of your choice.
6. Compile and run the SpartaRestapiApplication.main(), which is found at ```src/main/java/com/sparta/api/spartarestapi/SpartaRestapiApplication.java```
7. Once the application is running, _Swagger UI_ documentation for the endpoints can be viewed in your browser at: https://localhost:8080/

## Testing
To make sure the API works as intended we did a load of internal test on different layers of the project such as tests on:
- Repository
- All Controllers
- Factory

### Testing Framework
